Aumentaty Author is a software that allows users to create augmented reality (AR) content without programming. AR is a technology that overlays digital information on the real world, enhancing the user's perception and interaction. With Aumentaty Author, users can associate their 3D models to classic markers, which are printed images that can be recognized by a webcam or a mobile device. By dragging the name of the model on the marker, users can position and scale the 3D model on the screen, creating an immersive and interactive AR experience.

Augmented reality is a technology that enhances the user's perception of the real world by overlaying digital information on it. Unlike virtual reality, which creates a completely artificial environment, AR blends the real and the virtual, creating a mixed reality. AR can be experienced through various devices, such as smartphones, tablets, headsets and glasses. AR can provide users with useful information, interactive entertainment, immersive education and creative expression.
